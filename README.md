# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021. I only optimize my code in this project when the solution is not coming out fast enough. Code style / readability... out of the window.

## Day 1

Solved with node, extensive use of GitHub Copilot.

## Day 2

Solved with node, partially using GitHub Copilot and some tweaking. Funny detail: the proposed Copilot code referenced Santa: was this the solution to another year's challenge?

## Day 3

GitHub Copilot is still going strong, but I did struggle a bit.

## Day 4

Manipulating multi-dimensional arrays becomes easy when you don't have to think about it.

## Day 5

Copilot had to propose some alternatives for diagonal lines. :-)

## Day 6

Copilot did not give the most optimal solution right away, but it thought along nicely when I did.

## Day 7

This was kinda easy. The logic was simple, just had Copilot work out the code line per line. Not sure why I had to substract 1 from the average positions, but I did some investigating around the average and it turned out to be the correct answer. As the total consumed fuel was lower.

## Day 8

Lots of manual labor today. GitHub Copilot did not like 7-digit numbers...

## Day 9

GitHub Copilot; Grid logic. Easy.

## Day 10

Scoring and filtering did not go well with Copilot. Figuring out the brackets had to be done in multiple steps for Copilot to understand.

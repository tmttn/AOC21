# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021. I only optimize my code in this project when the solution is not coming out fast enough. Code style / readability... out of the window.

## Day 1

Solved with node, extensive use of GitHub Copilot.

## Day 2

Solved with node, partially using GitHub Copilot and some tweaking. Funny detail: the proposed Copilot code referenced Santa: was this the solution to another year's challenge?

## Day 3

GitHub Copilot is still going strong, but I did struggle a bit.

## Day 4

Manipulating multi-dimensional arrays becomes easy when you don't have to think about it.

## Day 5

Copilot had to propose some alternatives for diagonal lines. :-)

## Day 6

Copilot did not give the most optimal solution right away, but it thought along nicely when I did.

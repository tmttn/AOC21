# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions for (https://adventofcode.com/)[Advent of Code] 2021. I only optimize my code in thiis project when the solution is not coming out fast enough. Code style / readability... out of the window.

## Day 1

Solved with node, extensive use of GitHub Copilot.

## Day 2

Solved with node, partially using GitHub Copilot and some tweaking. Funny detail: the proposed Copilot code referenced Santa: was this the solution to another year's challenge?
